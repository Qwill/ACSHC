# ACSHC

This is a Kingdom of Loathing Mafia script for automating Advanced Cocktailcrafting and Superhuman Cocktailcrafting. It is designed for hardcore runs when you have limited ingredients and want to maximize the number of drinks you can craft. It will work outside of hardcore, but it will be slower and you probably have better options.

Input a number of drinks between one and ten, e.g. `ACSHC 5`. The script will choose AC or SHC drinks depending on your character, check all possible combinations of drinks you can make (including buyable garnishes if you have access to the Hippy Store), and craft the maximum number possible up to your requested quantity. You can also run a simulation to see the output without actually buying or crafting anything by adding "sim" to the command, e.g. `ACSHC 5 sim`.

To install the script, type `git checkout Qwill/ACSHC release` into Mafia's CLI.
